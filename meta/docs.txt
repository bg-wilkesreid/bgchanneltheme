This is working documentation.

-- Post Types --

- channel-video (Videos)

The creation of post types is handled in php/posttypes/create_posttypes.php

Each post type has its own folder where the specifics of its creation is defined, as well as
the creation of any meta boxes. There will be a folder for the 'page' and 'post' types,
and those will be specifically for the creation of meta boxes for those post types.

-- Modules --

We are working with the concept that we can create modules for reuse around the site.
These modules should be able to be used as shortcodes, widgets, and hopefully we will
add the ability to add modules to pages using a page builder like other themes.

Modules are defined in the php/modules folder. Each folder refers to just a group
of modules, and each individual file (except main.php) is a single module.

Modules are classes that implement the BGChannelModule interface defined in php/modules/main.php.

Modules must register with the BGChannelModuleController in order to be usable and to
have their shortcodes and widgets automatically generated. To do so,
call BGChannelModuleController::register( new ModuleClass() ) where ModuleClass is the
module's class.

BGChannelModuleController is where the automatic creation of shortcodes for every module
occurs. It will also automatically create widgets for use in sidebars as well as
modules for use in the upcoming page builder.

-- Styling/CSS --

All styling right now is based on UIKit (getuikit.com). There is going to be customization
of styling options, although not as much as some themes because we are comfortable
making most customization through css. Hopefully we will eventually have a built in
SASS editor in WordPress where we can make changes and it will compile to css upon saving.
